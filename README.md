# Acadence
A hosted web application for professors/teachers to manage attendance of students across classes.

Created using 
* Visual Studio Code
  * This is the IDE I chose to use, I chose this one for its versatility and compatibility with many of the different languages I am working with. It is also really easy working with git and extensions.
* Next.js 15.2.3 with React
  * This is the react framework that I am using. I use React for the user interface components and Next.js for things like routing, rendering, and typescript.
* Python 3.10.12 and Flask
  *  Using the Flask framework to handle requests and handle interactions with the database completely separate from any of the features that Next.js provides
* MySQL database
  * I am using MySQL Workbench connected to a MySQL server I have running on a virtual machine to design the database and from the workbench I am able to edit and define my tables and data.
* MantineUI
  * I am using the Mantine UI React Library for a consistent UI styling of the components and also for the use of some of the components I need to move data through in the application.
